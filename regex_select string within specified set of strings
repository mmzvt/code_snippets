I have found very similar posts but I can't quite get my regular expression right here.

I am trying to write a regular expression which returns a string which is between two other strings. For example: I want to get the string which resides between the strings "cow" and "milk"

My cow always gives milk

would return

"always gives"

Here is the expression I have pieced together so far:

(?=cow).*(?=milk)
However this returns the string "cow always gives"
